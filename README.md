# GlobalVsLocal
Repository of code for establishing how the global method compares to the local method for the paper "A global method for simulating intracellular signaling reduces computational time in multiscale agent-based models with systems biology applications"

To reproduce Figure 3 (Global method is comparable to local method but with sub- stantially reduced wall time), run Run_Figure3.m.

The files beginning with "Test_" can be run to create similar data to what is in the figures.
