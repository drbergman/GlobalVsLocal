# GlobalVsLocal
Repository of code for establishing how the global method compares to the local method for the paper "A global method for simulating intracellular signaling reduces computational time in multiscale agent-based models with systems biology applications"

# Reproducing Figures

## Figure 3 (Global method is comparable to local method but with substantially reduced wall time)

1. Run_Figure3.m: produces panels A-E. (this script also produces some panels for Figure 4)
2. Run_Figure3FG.m: produces panels F-G (data also used to create some SI figs)

The files beginning with "Test_" can be run to create similar data to what is in the figures.

## Figure 4 (Noise in the local method is negligible and follows predictable patterns)

1. Run_Figure3.m: produces panels A-B.
2. Run_Figure4CD.m: produces panels C-D. (also makes the same plot at other time points)

## Figure 5
